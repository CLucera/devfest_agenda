# devfest_agenda

Project created in 2024 to demonstrate function calls in Flutter.

This was part of a series of Talks done in 2024 during the GDG Devfest season in Italy.

Feel free to copy, for or take inspiration for your own project, if you want, you can share a coffee with me if we meet around at some event or conference!

You can find the slides for the talk here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZBspqPsCIc2CAeUQOloxKWr0ASnwHfYYh7wJcrhoyuQ/edit?usp=sharing
